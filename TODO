URGENT
- auto components number
- batch decomposition of stitched files

??
- more adjustable things in normalization?


FUTURE
- change smoothing ICON
- get better pure water spectrum
- more general plot modes (see TODOs in source code)
- add some metadata about what was done on the component and possibly some checklist to guide the user
